# DiceOut

### NOTE: This thing is still a Work in Progress. Files, instructions, and other stuff might change!

The simulates rolling three dice and scoring a certain number of points for different combinations.
When the app is launched you'll see this layout, the app will show a green background, and some text at the top and the bottom. 
There are three dice that appear in the middle and there is a Roll button that is customized with an image in the lower right corner. 
When you click the button or tap it if you have a touchscreen, the dice will change. If you get a matching pair you score 50 points. 
If you get three of a kind, you'll score based on the combination, 100 for three ones, 200 for three twos, 300 for three threes, et cetera.

The app will show the result of your roll and display the score you've earned so far. 
Pretty simple. But this app will teach you a lot about basic coding and get you familiar with the Java programming language and 
how to build apps for Android.
